The paper discusses how scRNA-seq has changed our understanding of type 2 diabetes (T2D) through unprecedented view of the islets of Langerhans at cellular resolution. Unlike bulk sequencing which captures only the average gene expression, scRNA-seq captures individual cell expression revealing heterogeniety crucial in disease pathology. The microarray technology was the first approach for the study of whole pancreatic islets, however, this method was limited by cellular variability. β cells, for example can constitute between 25-80% of the total islets, while α cells, 2%-67%. Therefore, small gene expression changes in β cells or other endocrine cells are often masked by variations in their RNA contribution. Subsequent techniques that separated α and β using surface antibodies improved resolution, however, this fails to disclose rare endocrine cell types such as δ, ɛ, and pancreatic polypeptide cells.

The advent of scRNA-seq has witnessed different gene expression analysis, that leads to new discoveries. For instance, Segerstolpe and colleagues characterized the transcriptome of ghrelin-producing ɛ cells, and found that, besides ghrelin, these cells express BMP4 mRNA and a ghrelin-associated long non-coding RNA-highlighting how scRNA-seq refines cell-type-specific gene signatures. Several analytical tools in scRNA-seq have been able to identify inherent variations in endocrine cells. Furthermore, heterogeneity has been identified in β cells with five different subtypes based on expression of RBP4, FFAR4/GPR120, ID1, ID2, and ID3. Studies comparing islet transcriptomics in T2D have identified differentially expressed genes across endocrine cell types, but results remain inconsistent due to limited sample sizes and disease complexity. Wang and colleagues found that α and β cells from T2D donors exhibit gene expression patterns with pediatric islet cells, suggesting dedifferentiation. scRNA-seq allows researchers to trace endocrine cell development over pseudotime, revealing β-cell subpopulations with high insulin synthesis and ER stress, indicating functional heterogeneity.

A key limitation of scRNA-seq is its incomplete transcript capture. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, which detects over 10,000 genes, single-cell methods often identify only a few hundred to a few thousand. Low-abundance transcripts are frequently missed, leading to dropouts that can falsely suggest cell heterogeneity. Also, scRNA-seq of pancreatic cells faces challenges due to wide range of gene expression levels within the same cell, however improvements to the methodology are being made such as molecular crowding SCRB-seq that increases sensitivity.

Future innovations, including spatial genomics and multi-omic approaches integrating RNA, chromatin, and protein data, promise deeper insights into islet cell biology and diabetes mechanisms.
